{"name":"Gyper","tagline":"A graph-based genotyper for aligned DNA sequencing data","body":"# Gyper\r\nGyper (Graph genotYPER) is a genotyper for aligned DNA sequencing data. The input files are BAM files that have been sorted and indexed (e.g. using samtools). Gyper creates a partial order graph which represent haplotypes. Currently only six HLA genes are supported: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1. Gyper aligns reads from certain position of the input BAM file to the graphs and determines the individual's haplotype in a fast and accurate manner.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* Boost>=1.56.0\r\n* SeqAn>=2.1.0 (in development)\r\n* zlib>=1.2.8\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Gyper is released with a CMake build system which requires CMake>=2.8.\r\n\r\n## Simple installation (unix-like systems)\r\n### Install dependencies\r\nInstall CMake, zlib, and Boost with a package manager of choice. E.g.\r\n\r\n* apt-get (Ubuntu/Debian): `sudo apt-get install cmake zlib libboost-all-dev`\r\n* pacman (Arch Linux): `sudo pacman -S cmake zlib boost`\r\n* RPM (Fedora/RHEL): `sudo yum install cmake zlib boost`\r\n\r\nInstalling SeqAn is a little tougher, since we need their development branch on Github. Here, I assume SeqAn is cloned to ~/git/seqan and built to ~/git/seqan-build.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir -p ~/git\r\ncd ~/git\r\ngit clone git@github.com:seqan/seqan.git seqan\r\ncd seqan\r\ngit checkout develop\r\ncd ~/git\r\nmkdir seqan-build\r\ncd seqan-build\r\ncmake ../seqan -DSEQAN_BUILD_SYSTEM=SEQAN_RELEASE_LIBRARY\r\nmake dox\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install Gyper\r\nHere we assume Gyper is cloned to ~/git/gyper and built in ~/git/gyper/build. \r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd ~/git\r\ngit clone git@github.com:gyper/gyper.git gyper\r\ncd gyper\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\nGyper should now be installed to `/usr/local/bin/gyper`.\r\n\r\n### User-only install\r\nMaybe you are a pawn in a big company, and you don't have root access on your computer. In this case, worry not, because you can still compile and use Gyper. I'll assume you have or can install cmake and zlib. Follow the instructions on [how to get Boost](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html). Then, [install and cmake SeqAn](http://seqan.readthedocs.org/en/latest/BuildManual/UsingTheSeqAnBuildSystem.html#user-library-installation) using the `-DSEQAN_BUILD_SYSTEM=SEQAN_RELEASE_LIBRARY` options because we only need the library.\r\n\r\nYou can specify the locations of both libraries when you use cmake, e.g.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncmake -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=/some/path/you/installed/boost_1_XX_0/ -DSEQAN_INCLUDE_PATH=/some/path/you/installed/seqan/include/ ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can also set the `BOOST_INCLUDEDIR` and `SEQAN_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variables. The Gyper binary file will be located in `./bin/gyper`. If you'd like, add it to your `PATH` variable.","google":"UA-68569890-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
